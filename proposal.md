# Fannie Mae Loan Predictor Machine Learning Model 

## By Joseph Nero 

### Description
This is an end to end machine learning model that will predict whether or not loans acquired by Fannie Mae will go into foreclosure using a variety of borrower data. 

### Use Case
* Users will be able to upload borrower data and predict whether that loan will be foreclosed or not. 

### MVP
* Clean data from Fannie Mae database. This will reformat the data in a way that will allow its use by the machine learning model. 
* Train the model using a generic algorithm 

### Tools for MVP
* Anaconda - Python Package Manager 
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
* numpy 
* ipython
* scipy

### Stretch Goals
* create a UI to visualize this process 
* create a unique algorithm to train the model with
* Honestly, the whole thing is a bit of a stretch goal. 

### Tools for stretch goals 
* Django to create an api that the javascript front end can query
